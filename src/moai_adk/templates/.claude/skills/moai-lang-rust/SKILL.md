## What It Does

Rust programming language patterns, memory safety, and systems programming with ownership.

**Key capabilities**:
- ✅ Memory safety without garbage collection
- ✅ Ownership and borrowing patterns
- ✅ Fearless concurrency
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Systems programming

---

## When to Use

- ✅ Writing safe concurrent code
- ✅ Building performance-critical applications
- ✅ Creating system-level software
- ✅ Implementing WebAssembly modules

---

## Core Rust Patterns

### Memory Safety
1. **Ownership System**: Memory management without GC
2. **Borrowing**: Safe reference sharing
3. **Lifetimes**: Reference validity tracking
4. **Smart Pointers**: Rc, Arc, Box patterns
5. **Unsafe Blocks**: Controlled unsafe operations

### Concurrency Patterns
- **Threads**: Safe multi-threading
- **Channels**: Message passing
- **Mutex/Arc**: Shared state management
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous programming
- **Tokio**: Async runtime ecosystem

---

## Dependencies

- Rust compiler and toolchain
- Cargo package manager
- Standard library
- Testing framework

---

## Works Well With

- `moai-lang-c` (C interoperability)
- `moai-essentials-perf` (Performance optimization)
- `moai-domain-backend` (System services)

---

## Changelog

- **v2.0.0** (2025-11-11): Added complete metadata, Rust programming patterns
- **v1.0.0** (2025-10-22): Initial Rust language support
