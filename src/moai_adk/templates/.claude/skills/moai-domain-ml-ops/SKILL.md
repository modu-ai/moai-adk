## 📊 Quick Reference (30 seconds)

**What It Does**: Comprehensive enterprise MLOps patterns covering ML pipeline orchestration (MLflow, Kubeflow, Airflow), model versioning and lineage tracking, feature engineering pipelines, deployment planning (Ray Serve, KServe), drift detection and monitoring, performance optimization (quantization, pruning, distillation), and metrics collection with health assessment.

**Core Capabilities**:
- ✅ ML pipeline orchestration (MLflow, Kubeflow, Airflow)
- ✅ Model version management and lineage tracking
- ✅ Feature engineering and data quality validation
- ✅ Model deployment planning (Ray Serve, KServe)
- ✅ Drift detection (data, model, concept drift)
- ✅ Performance optimization (quantization, pruning, distillation)
- ✅ MLOps metrics collection and health monitoring

**When to Use**:
- Building ML pipeline automation workflows
- Managing model versioning and experiment tracking
- Deploying models to production environments
- Monitoring model performance and detecting drift
- Optimizing inference latency and throughput
- Tracking training metrics and model health
- Implementing end-to-end MLOps workflows

**Framework Versions**(Enterprise 2025):
- MLflow 2.0+ (experiment tracking, model registry)
- Kubeflow 1.9+ (Kubernetes-native ML workflows)
- Ray Serve 2.0+ (scalable model serving)
- KServe 0.13+ (serverless ML inference)
