## Implementation Guide

## Continuous Detection Signals

### Signal 1: Terminology Usage
```
"How do I use useState?" 
  → Beginner (basic concept)

"What's the best pattern for managing state?"
  → Intermediate (pattern awareness)

"How does React's useState closure capture work?"
  → Advanced (implementation detail)

"Can we optimize useState with useMemo patterns in concurrent rendering?"
  → Expert (deep architectural knowledge)
```

### Signal 2: Code Complexity
```python
# Beginner: Simple, linear logic
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Intermediate: Using patterns
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, repo):
        self.repo = repo
    
    def get_user(self, user_id):
        return self.repo.find(user_id)

# Advanced: Complex architecture
async def get_user_with_cache(user_id, cache, repo):
    try:
        cached = await cache.get(f"user:{user_id}")
        if cached:
            return json.loads(cached)
    except CacheError:
        pass
    
    user = await repo.find(user_id)
    await cache.set(f"user:{user_id}", json.dumps(user))
    return user

# Expert: Framework internals
async def get_user_with_prefetch(user_id, cache, repo, query_planner):
    # Uses query optimization, connection pooling, prefetch logic
    plan = query_planner.optimize(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id={user_id}")
    # Custom execution with monitoring and fallback strategies
```

### Signal 3: Question Type Patterns
```
"How do I...?"           → Beginner
"What's the best way to...?" → Intermediate
"Why does X work like Y?" → Advanced
"How does the implementation..." → Expert
```

### Signal 4: Error Patterns
```
Beginner: Syntax errors, missing imports, undefined variables
Intermediate: Logic errors, wrong patterns, performance issues
Advanced: Race conditions, memory leaks, optimization gaps
Expert: Language semantics, compiler optimizations, platform-specific bugs
```


## Dynamic Response Calibration

### Content Depth Adjustment

```
Beginner:   Explain → Example → Hands-on (3 steps)
Intermediate: Pattern → Example → Optimization (3 steps)
Advanced:   Theory → Implementation → Edge cases (3 steps)
Expert:     Design decision → Trade-offs → Implications (3 steps)
```

### Example Complexity Matching

```
# Beginner: Simple, complete example
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Intermediate: Pattern-based example
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

# Advanced: Complex but realistic
class MonoidCalculator(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, empty: T, combine: Callable[[T, T], T]):
        self.empty = empty
        self.combine = combine
    
    def fold(self, values: List[T]) -> T:
        return reduce(self.combine, values, self.empty)

# Expert: Framework-level implementation
async def compute_with_cache(
    key: str,
    fn: Callable[[], Awaitable[T]],
    cache: CacheLayer,
    options: ComputeOptions
) -> T:
    # Implementation with error handling, observability, etc.
```

### Terminology Usage

```
Beginner:   "function", "loop", "variable"
Intermediate: "closure", "prototype", "event loop"
Advanced:   "hoisting", "temporal dead zone", "thunk"
Expert:     "reification", "lifting", "unfold semantics"
```



## Advanced Patterns

## What It Does

Continuously detects and adapts to user expertise level based on behavioral signals, communication patterns, code examples, and interaction history. Enables Alfred to calibrate complexity, example selection, and communication style dynamically.


## Best Practices for Detection

### DO
- ✅ Update assessment based on each interaction
- ✅ Assume growth (someone at intermediate → advanced)
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions if uncertain
- ✅ Provide escape hatches ("Want more detail?")
- ✅ Err toward more detail (better to simplify)
- ✅ Learn from code examples provided
- ✅ Adapt communication style smoothly

### DON'T
- ❌ Lock expertise level (reassess continuously)
- ❌ Assume based on single signal
- ❌ Be patronizing to beginners
- ❌ Be overly technical without context
- ❌ Skip basics for advanced users (sometimes needed)
- ❌ Assume all users in same domain at same level
