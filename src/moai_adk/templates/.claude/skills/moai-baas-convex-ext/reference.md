## API Reference

### Core Convex Operations
- `defineSchema(schemaDefinition)` - Define database schema
- `mutation({...})` - Define data mutation function
- `query({...})` - Define data query function
- `action({...})` - Define server action function
- `scheduler.runAfter(delay, function, args)` - Schedule delayed execution

### Context7 Integration
- `get_latest_convex_documentation()` - Official Convex docs via Context7
- `analyze_realtime_patterns()` - Real-time architecture via Context7
- `optimize_typescript_configuration()` - TypeScript optimization via Context7

## Best Practices (November 2025)

### DO
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Optimize real-time subscriptions with smart filtering
- Use batching for bulk operations to improve performance
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Monitor real-time performance and optimize bottlenecks
- Use self-hosting for compliance and data residency requirements
- Implement comprehensive testing for real-time features

### DON'T
- Skip authentication checks in functions
- Create overly complex schemas that impact performance
- Ignore real-time subscription costs and optimization
- Forget to handle version conflicts in collaborative editing
- Skip proper error handling for network issues
- Neglect monitoring and performance optimization
- Overuse real-time features where they're not needed
- Ignore security considerations for self-hosted deployments

## Works Well With

- `moai-baas-foundation` (Enterprise BaaS architecture patterns)
- `moai-domain-backend` (Backend development patterns)
- `moai-domain-frontend` (Frontend integration with Convex)
- `moai-essentials-perf` (Performance optimization)
- `moai-foundation-trust` (Security and authentication)
- `moai-baas-supabase-ext` (PostgreSQL alternative comparison)
- `moai-baas-firebase-ext` (Real-time alternative comparison)
- `moai-domain-ml` (Real-time ML integration)
