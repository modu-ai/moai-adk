## Best Practices

✅ **DO**:
- Use Context7 integration for latest Convex documentation and real-time patterns
- Implement comprehensive real-time monitoring with sync performance analysis
- Optimize conflict resolution strategies for collaboration features
- Use reactive programming patterns for optimal user experience
- Monitor collaboration metrics and user engagement patterns
- Implement proper subscription management for performance optimization
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Establish clear testing strategies for real-time functionality

❌ **DON'T**:
- Skip real-time performance monitoring and sync optimization
- Ignore conflict resolution strategies for collaborative features
- Underestimate subscription management for performance
- Skip TypeScript type safety and validation implementation
- Neglect proper error handling and recovery patterns
- Use inappropriate data modeling for real-time applications
- Skip testing strategies for real-time collaboration features
- Ignore user experience optimization for real-time interactions
