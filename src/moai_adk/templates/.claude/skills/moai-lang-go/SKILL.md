## What It Does

Go programming language patterns, goroutines, and concurrent programming best practices.

**Key capabilities**:
- ✅ Goroutine orchestration
- ✅ Channel communication
- ✅ Concurrent design patterns
- ✅ Microservice architecture
- ✅ Performance optimization

---

## When to Use

- ✅ Building concurrent applications
- ✅ Creating microservices
- ✅ Implementing high-performance systems
- ✅ Developing CLI tools

---

## Core Go Patterns

### Concurrency Patterns
1. **Goroutines**: Lightweight thread management
2. **Channels**: Safe communication patterns
3. **Select Statements**: Multiplexing operations
4. **Worker Pools**: Concurrent task processing
5. **Context Cancellation**: Graceful shutdown patterns

### Microservice Architecture
- **HTTP Servers**: RESTful API patterns
- **gRPC Services**: High-performance RPC
- **Database Integration**: SQL/NoSQL patterns
- **Middleware**: Request/response processing
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service location

---

## Dependencies

- Go toolchain
- Module management (go mod)
- Standard library packages
- Testing framework

---

## Works Well With

- `moai-domain-backend` (Backend services)
- `moai-domain-devops` (Deployment patterns)
- `moai-essentials-perf` (Performance optimization)

---

## Changelog

- **v2.0.0** (2025-11-11): Added complete metadata, Go programming patterns
- **v1.0.0** (2025-10-22): Initial Go language support
