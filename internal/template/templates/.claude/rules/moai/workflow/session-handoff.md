# Session Handoff Protocol

Long-running session continuity: clean transitions across context boundaries via paste-ready resume messages.

> **Loading scope**: Intentionally always-loaded (no `paths:` restriction) because Trigger #3 (user explicit session-end) can fire from any session context, including those without SPEC files. The ~1,400-token cost is justified by cross-cutting applicability.

## Why This Matters

Long workflows (multi-SPEC waves, multi-milestone implementation) accumulate context that exceeds the window or benefits from fresh start. Without a standardized handoff, session boundaries lose work-in-progress. This rule defines when to emit a paste-ready resume, the 6-block structure, and auto-memory integration that persists across `/clear`.

## When To Generate (5 Triggers)

[ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] The orchestrator MUST emit a paste-ready resume message when ANY of these conditions activate:

| # | Trigger | Detection |
|---|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Context usage crosses model-specific threshold (cumulative input+output) | **1M context model (Opus 4.7): 50%** (~500,000 tokens). **200K context model (Sonnet/Opus standard, Haiku): 90%** (~180,000 tokens). Heuristic per `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/context-window-management.md` §Detection Heuristics. |
| 2 | SPEC phase completion (plan/run/sync) within a multi-SPEC workflow | Phase boundary in `.claude/rules/moai/workflow/spec-workflow.md` §Phase Transitions (after plan/run/sync phase finishes within a multi-SPEC SPEC ID series) |
| 3 | User explicitly requests session end ("세션 종료", "이번 세션 마무리", "next session") | Intent detection in user message |
| 4 | PR creation success when more SPECs remain in the current wave | After `gh pr create` success + memory indicates >0 pending SPECs |
| 5 | Long-running multi-milestone task reaches a stable checkpoint | After milestone Mn complete + Mn+1 not yet started |

When NONE apply (single-turn, trivial task, read-only query), emit a brief completion confirmation. The threshold in Trigger #1 reflects asymmetric stall risk: 1M models tolerate higher absolute load; 200K models hit the ceiling earlier. The `/clear` policy in `context-window-management.md` is co-anchored to the same threshold per model class.

## Canonical Format (Verbatim Spec)

[ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] Resume message MUST follow this exact 6-block structure, **bounded by cut-line markers** (`✂──── 여기부터 복사 ────✂` top, `✂──── 여기까지 복사 ────✂` bottom). Cut-line markers sit **inside** the fenced text block alongside the content so they are copied verbatim with the message; this provides the user an unambiguous copy boundary in long terminal scrollback:

```
✂──── 여기부터 복사 ────✂

ultrathink. <SPEC-ID> <phase> 진입.
applied lessons: <memory-file-1>, <memory-file-2>, ...

전제 검증:
1) <verifiable precondition 1>
2) <verifiable precondition 2>
N) <verifiable precondition N>

실행: <command-or-action>

머지 후: <next-action-or-spec>

✂──── 여기까지 복사 ────✂
```

### Cut-line Marker Specification

- Top marker: `✂──── 여기부터 복사 ────✂` (scissors U+2702 + 4× U+2500 + space + text + space + 4× U+2500 + scissors)
- Bottom marker: `✂──── 여기까지 복사 ────✂` (same structure, text differs)
- One blank line separates each marker from adjacent block content (top → blank → Block 1; Block 6 → blank → bottom)
- `✂` symbol (U+2702 BLACK SCISSORS) is **preserved verbatim across all locales** — never translate or substitute
- Box-drawing characters (`─` U+2500) preserved verbatim
- Marker text translates per `conversation_language` (see Localization table below)

### Localization Table

| Marker | English | Korean (canonical) | Japanese | Chinese |
|--------|---------|--------------------|----------|---------|
| Top text | `Copy from here` | `여기부터 복사` | `ここからコピー` | `从这里复制` |
| Bottom text | `Copy to here` | `여기까지 복사` | `ここまでコピー` | `到这里复制` |

Read `conversation_language` from `.moai/config/sections/language.yaml` at render time; substitute the localized text between the `✂────` decorators while keeping `✂` and `─` characters verbatim.

### Field-by-Field Specification

- **Block 1**: `ultrathink.` triggers Adaptive Thinking xhigh effort on Opus 4.7+ (next session lacks accumulated reasoning). `<phase>` ∈ `plan | run | sync | loop`.
- **Block 2**: `applied lessons:` — relevant memory files from `~/.claude/projects/{hash}/memory/`. MUST include the most recent relevant project memory + any relevant lessons. Block 2 MUST also include a `source_session_id: <UUID>` line carrying the Claude Code session_id of the orchestrator turn that generated this resume message per the canonical multi-session coordination policy. The session_id is the same value emitted by `moai session list --json` and stored in `.moai/state/active-sessions.json` — readers can correlate the resume back to its originating session.
  - **Environment fallback** [HARD]: if `moai session list --json` returns error (CLI not installed in PATH) OR `.moai/state/active-sessions.json` does not exist (the multi-session coordination layer not yet deployed in this project), the orchestrator MUST emit the recognized fallback pattern verbatim: `source_session_id: <not-available — environment-fallback, next session will backfill via /moai session register on activation>`. This pattern is NOT an anti-pattern; it is the prescribed graceful degradation when the CLI/registry layer is absent. The next session, upon `/moai session register` activation, MAY backfill the UUID by appending a `[backfilled: <UUID>]` annotation to the memory file's Block 2 line.
- **Block 3**: separator + `전제 검증:` (Korean) or `Preconditions:` (English).
- **Block 4**: numbered preconditions `<N>) <action> → <expected outcome>`. Each MUST be independently verifiable (git/gh command, file existence). Max 4 preconditions.
- **Block 5**: separator + `실행: <command-or-action>` — single primary action (typically `/moai <subcommand>`).
- **Block 6**: separator + `<workflow-context header>: <next-action-or-spec>` — RECOMMENDED for multi-SPEC waves or follow-up; **omit entirely** for single-SPEC close with no further actions queued.
  - **Header selection (workflow-context conditional)**:
    - **PR-based workflow** (feat/* → PR → merge): `머지 후:` (en `After merge:`)
    - **Trunk-based no-PR** (e.g., 1-person OSS, all-tier main 직진 push, no merge step): `후속:` (en `Follow-up:`)
    - **Single-SPEC close** (no further SPEC/phase queued): omit Block 6 entirely
  - **Single action principle**: `<next-action-or-spec>` MUST be one concrete SPEC ID, one command, or one phase transition — avoid vague "사이클 반복" / "iteration loop" phrasing that reads as infinite recursion.

실행: /moai run SPEC-MYPROJ-001

머지 후: SPEC-MYPROJ-002 → SPEC-MYPROJ-003

✂──── 여기까지 복사 ────✂
```

## Auto-Memory Integration (Mandatory)

[ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] When generating a resume message, the orchestrator MUST also:

1. Save the message to a memory project entry. Filename pattern: `project_<wave>_<spec>_<status>.md` (e.g., `project_wave6_wf002_complete.md`).
2. Include the resume message verbatim in that file under a `## 다음 세션 시작점 (paste-ready resume message)` heading.
3. Update `MEMORY.md` index with a one-line entry pointing to the new memory file.
4. Mark superseded entries (if any) with `[SUPERSEDED by <new-file>]` prefix per Lessons Protocol in `.claude/rules/moai/core/moai-constitution.md` §Lessons Protocol.

This ensures the message survives `/clear` and is discoverable at the start of the next session's context.

## Output Surface (User-Facing)

At session end, the orchestrator displays: (1) the message in a fenced ```text``` block **bounded by cut-line markers** (`✂──── 여기부터 복사 ────✂` top + `✂──── 여기까지 복사 ────✂` bottom, with marker text translated per `conversation_language` and `✂` symbol preserved verbatim) for verbatim paste, (2) the memory file path, (3) a one-sentence summary of what next session continues.

## Anti-Patterns

- Free-form prose handoff — no executable context.
- Resume without preconditions — next session cannot detect state drift.
- Resume without `ultrathink.` — fails to activate xhigh effort.
- Resume saved only to chat, not auto-memory — lost across `/clear`.
- Duplicate memory entries without `[SUPERSEDED by ...]` markers — index pollution.
- Resume Block 2 missing `source_session_id: <UUID>` **AND missing the environment fallback pattern** (`<not-available — environment-fallback, ...>`) — the canonical multi-session coordination policy cannot correlate the resume back to its originating session for race attribution. The environment fallback pattern itself is NOT an anti-pattern; only the complete absence of both UUID and fallback pattern is the violation.
- Forcing the format on trivial tasks — memory noise.
- Cut-line markers absent — user cannot identify exact copy boundary in long terminal scrollback.
- Cut-line markers translated `✂` symbol or `─` decorator — only the marker text translates; the symbols are preserved verbatim.

## Worktree-Anchored Resume Pattern

[ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] When the SPEC was initialized via L3 `/moai plan --worktree` (creating an L2 SPEC worktree at `~/.moai/worktrees/<project>/<spec-or-name>/`), the resume message MUST include **Block 0 (cwd anchoring)** prepended before the standard 6-block structure. Without Block 0, the next session starts in main project cwd by default, breaking L2 SPEC worktree isolation expectations.

> Per user policy 2026-05-17 (`feedback_worktree_autonomous` memory): L3 `--worktree` is **user opt-in** only. For SPECs initialized without `--worktree` (the default as of 2026-05-17), the standard 6-block structure suffices — Block 0 is NOT required.

### Why Block 0 (L3 `--worktree` opt-in only)

With L3 `--worktree`, SPEC artifacts and L1 isolation base live in a different cwd. Pasting resume into a main-cwd session causes: L1 base divergence (lessons #13), Bash commands targeting main project (lessons #12), build/test from the wrong tree. Block 0 forces a new terminal session **inside** the L2 worktree before any action.

### Block 0 Format

Block 0 is **prepended** before Block 1:

```
[New Terminal — START IN WORKTREE]
$ cd <worktree-absolute-path>
$ <launcher>     # Choose one: moai cc | moai glm | claude
   └─ Claude Code session starts here (cwd = worktree)
```

[ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] Block 0 MUST surface the 3 primary launchers verbatim so the user can choose without consulting external docs:

1. `moai cc` — Claude Code leader with MoAI orchestration (default for normal SPEC work; supports `-p <name>` profile flag)
2. `moai glm` — cost-optimized GLM-only worker mode (no Claude Code leader, lower token cost)
3. `claude` — native Claude Code without MoAI wrapper (minimal fallback)

Advanced launchers (use only when user explicitly requests, NOT auto-surfaced in Block 0):
- `moai cc --bypass` — sandboxed-only execution (testing scenarios)
- `moai cg` — Claude leader + GLM teammates parallel mode (requires `tmux new-session -s <name>` first; pair with `--team`)

### Updated Block 4 (Preconditions)

When Block 0 is present, the **first precondition (0)** verifies compliance:

```
0) git rev-parse --show-toplevel → <worktree-path> (★ critical pre-check)
```

If verification 0) fails, stop and instruct the user to restart inside the worktree.

### Single-Session vs Multi-Session Decision

Block 0 is REQUIRED only with L3 `--worktree`. For `--branch` (or no flag — 2026-05-17 default), standard 6-block suffices because main session cwd already follows the branch.

[ZONE:Evolvable] [HARD] If L3 `--worktree` was used and the user is NOT comfortable with multi-terminal/multi-session workflow, the orchestrator SHOULD recommend `--branch` for the next SPEC. Forcing Block 0 onto a single-session user is friction without benefit. See lessons #14 for the single-session vs multi-session decision rationale.

### Example with Block 0 (Illustrative)

```
