## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

#### Recommended: uv tool (CLI - Global Access)

```bash
# Install moai-adk as a globally available command using uv tool
uv tool install moai-adk

# Verify installation
moai-adk --version

# Initialize a new project (available everywhere)
moai-adk init my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
```

#### Alternative: Using pip

```bash
# Traditional pip installation
pip install moai-adk

# Initialize a new project
moai-adk init my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
```

#### Upgrade to Latest Version

```bash
# Update using uv tool (recommended)
uv tool upgrade moai-adk

# Or reinstall
uv tool install --force moai-adk
```

#### ⚠️ Important: Setup Optimization

After installation or upgrade, you **MUST** run setup optimization to configure your project:

```bash
# Configure project settings and optimize for your environment
/alfred:0-project
```

This command initializes project metadata, language settings, and development configuration. Run this first before starting any development!

### 5-Minute Quick Start

```bash
# 0. Create and initialize a new project
moai-adk init my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project

# 1. Optimize project configuration
/alfred:0-project

# 2. Create a SPEC for a feature
/alfred:1-plan "User authentication with JWT"

# 3. Implement with automated TDD
/alfred:2-run AUTH-001

# 4. Sync documentation automatically
/alfred:3-sync
```

That's it! You now have:
- ✅ Clear SPEC document
- ✅ Comprehensive tests
- ✅ Implementation code
- ✅ Updated documentation
- ✅ Git history with @TAG references

## 🧠 How Alfred Processes Your Instructions - Detailed Workflow Analysis

Alfred orchestrates the complete development lifecycle through a systematic 4-step workflow. Here's how Alfred understands, plans, executes, and validates your requests:

### Step 1: Intent Understanding

**Goal**: Clarify user intent before any action

**How it works:**
- Alfred evaluates request clarity:
  - **HIGH clarity**: Technical stack, requirements, scope all specified → Skip to Step 2
  - **MEDIUM/LOW clarity**: Multiple interpretations possible → Alfred uses `AskUserQuestion` to clarify

**When Alfred asks clarifying questions:**
- Ambiguous requests (multiple interpretations)
- Architecture decisions needed
- Technology stack selections required
- Business/UX decisions involved

**Example:**
```
User: "Add authentication to the system"

Alfred's Analysis:
- Is it JWT, OAuth, or session-based? (UNCLEAR)
- Which authentication flow? (UNCLEAR)
- Multi-factor authentication needed? (UNCLEAR)

Action: Ask clarifying questions via AskUserQuestion
```

### Step 2: Plan Creation

**Goal**: Create a pre-approved execution strategy

**Process:**
1. **Mandatory Plan Agent Invocation**: Alfred calls the Plan agent to:
   - Decompose tasks into structured steps
   - Identify dependencies between tasks
   - Determine single vs parallel execution opportunities
   - Specify exactly which files will be created/modified/deleted
   - Estimate work scope and expected time

2. **User Plan Approval**: Alfred presents the plan via AskUserQuestion:
   - Share the complete file change list in advance
   - Explain implementation approach clearly
   - Disclose risk factors in advance

3. **TodoWrite Initialization**: Create task list based on approved plan:
   - List all task items explicitly
   - Define clear completion criteria for each task

**Example Plan for Authentication SPEC:**
```markdown
## Plan for SPEC-AUTH-001

### Files to be Created
- .moai/specs/SPEC-AUTH-001/spec.md
- .moai/specs/SPEC-AUTH-001/plan.md
- .moai/specs/SPEC-AUTH-001/acceptance.md

### Implementation Phases
1. RED: Write failing authentication tests
2. GREEN: Implement JWT token service
3. REFACTOR: Improve error handling and security
4. SYNC: Update documentation

### Risks
- Third-party service integration latency
- Token storage security considerations
```

### Step 3: Task Execution (Strict TDD Compliance)

**Goal**: Execute tasks following TDD principles with transparent progress tracking

**TDD Execution Cycle:**

**1. RED Phase** - Write failing tests first
- Write test code ONLY
- Tests should fail (intentionally)
- No implementation code changes
- Track progress: `TodoWrite: "RED: Write failing tests" → in_progress`

**2. GREEN Phase** - Minimal code to make tests pass
- Add ONLY minimal code necessary for test passing
- No over-engineering
- Focus on making tests pass
- Track progress: `TodoWrite: "GREEN: Minimal implementation" → in_progress`

**3. REFACTOR Phase** - Improve code quality
- Improve design while maintaining test passing
- Remove code duplication
- Enhance readability and maintainability
- Track progress: `TodoWrite: "REFACTOR: Improve code quality" → in_progress`

**TodoWrite Rules:**
- Each task: `content` (imperative), `activeForm` (present continuous), `status` (pending/in_progress/completed)
- **Exactly ONE task in_progress** at any time
- **Real-time Update Obligation**: Immediate status change on task start/completion
- **Strict Completion Criteria**: Mark completed only when tests pass, implementation complete, and error-free

**Forbidden during execution:**
- ❌ Implementation code changes during RED phase
- ❌ Over-engineering during GREEN phase
- ❌ Task execution without TodoWrite tracking
- ❌ Code generation without tests

**Real-World Example - Agent Model Directive Change:**

*Context:* User requested changing all agent model directives from `sonnet` to `inherit` to enable dynamic model selection

**Plan Approval:**
- 26 files to change (13 local + 13 template files)
- Files clearly identified: `implementation-planner.md`, `spec-builder.md`, etc.
- Risk: Merge conflicts on develop branch → Mitigated with `-X theirs` strategy

**RED Phase:**
- Write tests validating all agent files have `model: inherit`
- Verify template files match local files

**GREEN Phase:**
- Update 13 local agent files: `model: sonnet` → `model: inherit`
- Update 13 template agent files using Python script for portability
- Verify no other model directives changed

**REFACTOR Phase:**
- Review agent file consistency
- Ensure no orphaned changes
- Validate pre-commit hook passes

**Result:**
- All 26 files successfully updated
- Pre-commit @TAG validation passed
- Feature branch merged to develop with clean history

### Step 4: Report & Commit

**Goal**: Document work and create git history on demand

**Configuration Compliance First:**
- Check `.moai/config.json` `report_generation` settings
- If `enabled: false` → Provide status reports only, NO file generation
- If `enabled: true` AND user explicitly requests → Generate documentation files

**Git Commit:**
- Call git-manager for all Git operations
- Follow TDD commit cycle: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Each commit message captures the workflow phase and purpose

**Example Commit Sequence:**

```bash
# RED: Write failing tests
commit 1: "test: Add authentication integration tests"

# GREEN: Minimal implementation
commit 2: "feat: Implement JWT token service (minimal)"

# REFACTOR: Improve quality
commit 3: "refactor: Enhance JWT error handling and security"

# Merge to develop
commit 4: "merge: Merge SPEC-AUTH-001 to develop"
```

**Project Cleanup:**
- Delete unnecessary temporary files
- Remove excessive backups
- Keep workspace organized and clean
