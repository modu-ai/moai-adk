# [Case Study Title: Quantified Business Impact]

## Executive Summary

[1-2 sentence hook with key result]

**Quick Stats:**
- **Challenge**: [One sentence summary of the problem]
- **Solution**: [One sentence summary of the approach]
- **Result**: [Quantified outcome, e.g., "50% faster page loads"]
- **Timeline**: [How long it took, e.g., "3 months"]
- **Team Size**: [Who was involved, e.g., "2 engineers, 1 product manager"]

## The Problem

### Situation

[Context setting: What was the environment? What were the constraints?]

**Key Pain Points:**
