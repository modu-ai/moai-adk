> **MoAI-ADK delivers a seamless development workflow that naturally connects SPEC → TEST (TDD) → CODE → DOCUMENTATION with AI.**

## What is MoAI-ADK?

### The Trust Crisis in AI Development

Today, countless developers want help from Claude or ChatGPT, but can't shake one fundamental doubt: **"Can I really trust the code this AI generates?"**

The reality looks like this. Ask an AI to "build a login feature" and you'll get syntactically perfect code. But these problems keep repeating:

- **Unclear Requirements**: The basic question "What exactly should we build?" remains unanswered. Email/password login? OAuth? 2FA? Everything relies on guessing.
- **Missing Tests**: Most AIs only test the "happy path". Wrong password? Network error? Three months later, bugs explode in production.
- **Documentation Drift**: Code gets modified but docs stay the same. The question "Why is this code here?" keeps repeating.
- **Context Loss**: Even within the same project, you have to explain everything from scratch each time. Project structure, decision rationale, previous attempts—nothing gets recorded.
- **Impact Tracking Impossible**: When requirements change, you can't track which code is affected.

### The Solution: SPEC-First TDD with Alfred SuperAgent

**MoAI-ADK** (MoAI Agentic Development Kit) is an open-source framework designed to **systematically solve** these problems.

The core principle is simple yet powerful:

> **"No tests without code, no SPEC without tests"**

More precisely, it's the reverse order:

> **"SPEC comes first. No tests without SPEC. No complete documentation without tests and code."**

When you follow this order, magical things happen.

## MoAI-ADK's 3 Core Promises

For beginners to remember easily, MoAI-ADK's value simplifies to three things:

### First, SPEC comes before code

Start by clearly defining what to build. Writing SPEC helps discover problems before implementation. Communication costs with teammates drop dramatically.

### Second, tests drive code (TDD)

Write tests before implementation (RED). Implement minimally to pass tests (GREEN). Then clean up the code (REFACTOR). Result: fewer bugs, confidence in refactoring, code anyone can understand.

### Third, documentation and code always match

One `/alfred:3-sync` command auto-updates all documentation. README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and Living Documents always sync with code. No more despair when modifying six-month-old code.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install moai-adk

# Or using pip
pip install moai-adk
```

### Your First Project

```bash
# Initialize project
moai-adk init my-project

# Start with Alfred
cd my-project
/alfred:0-project  # Project setup
/alfred:1-plan     # Write SPEC
/alfred:2-run      # TDD implementation
/alfred:3-sync     # Sync documentation
```

## Key Features

### 1️⃣ Clear Requirements

Write SPECs first with the `/alfred:1-plan` command. A vague request like "login feature" transforms into **clear requirements** like "WHEN valid credentials are provided, the system SHALL issue a JWT token".

### 2️⃣ Test Guarantee

`/alfred:2-run` automatically performs Test-Driven Development (TDD). It proceeds in RED (failing test) → GREEN (minimal implementation) → REFACTOR (cleanup) order, **guaranteeing 85%+ test coverage**.

### 3️⃣ Automatic Documentation Sync

A single `/alfred:3-sync` command **synchronizes** all code, tests, and documentation. README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and Living Documents all update automatically.

### 4️⃣ Tracking with @TAG System

Every piece of code, test, and documentation gets a `@TAG:ID`. When requirements change later, one command—`rg "@SPEC:AUTH-001"`—**finds all related tests, implementations, and docs**.

### 5️⃣ Alfred Remembers Context

A team of AI agents collaborate to **remember** your project's structure, decision rationale, and work history. No need to repeat the same questions.
