# MoAI-ADK Key Concepts

## 1. SPEC-First Development

All development starts with clear requirement definitions.

### EARS Syntax

**E**asy **A**pproach to **R**equirements **S**yntax

```
WHEN [condition]
WHILE [state]
WHERE [constraint]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [action]
```

### Example

```markdown
WHEN valid email and password are provided,
THE SYSTEM SHALL issue a JWT token.

WHERE email format is invalid,
THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 400 error.
```

## 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Follows the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle.

### RED Phase
- Write failing test
- Express requirements as test code

### GREEN Phase
- Minimal implementation to pass test
- Follow YAGNI principle

### REFACTOR Phase
- Improve code quality
- Improve structure without changing functionality

## 3. @TAG System

Connects all SPEC, TEST, CODE, DOC.

### TAG Format

```
@SPEC:AUTH-001    # SPEC requirement
@TEST:AUTH-001    # Test code
@CODE:AUTH-001    # Implementation code
@DOC:AUTH-001     # Documentation
```

### Traceability

```bash
# Find all code related to specific SPEC
rg "@SPEC:AUTH-001"

# Result
# src/auth.py:15:    # @CODE:AUTH-001
# tests/test_auth.py:8:    # @TEST:AUTH-001
# docs/api.md:42:    <!-- @DOC:AUTH-001 -->
```

## 4. Alfred SuperAgent

Team of 19 AI agents collaborating.

### Core Agents

- **spec-builder**: Write SPEC
- **tdd-implementer**: TDD implementation
- **doc-syncer**: Documentation sync
- **git-manager**: Git operations

### Skills System

55 reusable knowledge capsules:
- Foundation: EARS, TRUST, TAG
- Essentials: TDD, Refactor, Debug
- Alfred: Commands, Context, Memory

## 5. TRUST 5 Principles

Code quality standards.

### T - Test First
Write tests first.

### R - Readable
Write readable code.

### U - Unified
Maintain unified coding style.

### S - Secured
Consider security.

### T - Trackable
Make traceable with @TAG.
