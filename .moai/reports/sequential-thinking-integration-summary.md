# @sequential-thinking MCP Integration - Executive Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully implemented systematic integration of @sequential-thinking MCP and AskUserQuestion recommendations into MoAI-ADK commands, agents, and instructions that require complex strategy or reasoning.

## 📊 Implementation Results

### Phase 1: Complete ✅
- **Commands**: 4/4 fully integrated (tag-audit, tag-migrate, tag-renumber, tag-reserve)
- **Core Agents**: 2/2 integrated (spec-builder, implementation-planner - already had integration)
- **High-Priority Agent**: 1/1 integrated (project-manager)

### Phase 2: In Progress 🔄 (33% Complete)
- **Core Workflow Agents**: 2/2 integrated (tdd-implementer, git-manager)
- **Remaining High Priority**: 4/6 agents to integrate

### Overall Progress: 6/25 Components (24% Complete)

## 🔧 Integration Pattern Established

### Standard Template Applied to All Components

1. **Tool Integration**: Added `mcp__sequential_thinking_think` to tools list
2. **Documentation Note**: Clear notice about @sequential-thinking MCP usage
3. **Complex Strategy Section**: Dedicated sections for complex decision scenarios
