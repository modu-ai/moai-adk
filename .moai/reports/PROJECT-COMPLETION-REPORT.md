### Key Implementation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Dynamic Skill Loading

**Concept**: Agents load skills on-demand using `Skill()` tool

**Example**:
```python
# Agent receives delegation
Task(
  subagent_type="backend-expert",
  description="Implement REST API"
)

# Agent internally loads skills:
Skill("moai-domain-backend")     # Core backend patterns
Skill("moai-security-api")       # API security
Skill("moai-lang-python")        # Python implementation

# Executes task with full skill set
```

**Benefits**:
- No pre-configuration required
- Skills loaded only when needed
- Flexible and efficient
- Context-aware loading

#### Pattern 2: Multi-Skill Combination

**Concept**: Agents combine complementary skills seamlessly

**Example** (backend-expert implementing authentication):
```python
Skills loaded:
1. moai-domain-backend        # Architecture patterns
2. moai-security-api          # API security
3. moai-security-auth         # Authentication
4. moai-essentials-perf       # Performance
5. moai-lang-python           # FastAPI implementation
6. moai-domain-database       # Database layer

Result: Comprehensive implementation combining all 6 skill domains
```

**Benefits**:
- Cross-domain expertise
- No skill conflicts
- Comprehensive solutions
- Production-ready output

#### Pattern 3: Quality-First Validation

**Concept**: TRUST 5 principles integrated throughout execution

**Example** (quality-gate validation):
```python
Skills loaded:
1. moai-foundation-trust      # TRUST 5 framework
2. moai-essentials-review     # Code review
3. moai-core-code-reviewer    # Review patterns
4. moai-domain-testing        # Testing strategies

Validation performed:
- Test-first: 85%+ coverage required
- Readable: Code quality metrics
- Unified: Consistency checks
- Secured: OWASP compliance
- Trackable: Git history validation
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent quality standards
- Automated validation
- Comprehensive checks
- Production confidence

#### Pattern 4: Design & Implementation Chain

**Concept**: Skills pass correctly between coordinated agents

**Example** (API design pipeline):
```python
# Agent 1: api-designer
Skills: moai-domain-web-api, moai-domain-backend, moai-lang-typescript
Output: REST API specification with OpenAPI schema

# Agent 2: backend-expert
Skills: moai-domain-backend, moai-security-api, moai-lang-python
Input: API specification from api-designer
Output: FastAPI implementation with security

# Agent 3: security-expert
Skills: All 9 security skills
Input: Implementation from backend-expert
Output: Security validation report with OWASP compliance
```

**Benefits**:
- Seamless agent coordination
- Progressive quality enhancement
- Context preservation
- End-to-end validation

#### Pattern 5: Security-Enhanced Development

**Concept**: Security validation integrated throughout development

**Example** (security-expert validation):
```python
Skills loaded (all 9 security skills):
1. moai-security-auth         # Authentication
2. moai-security-encryption   # Encryption
3. moai-security-compliance   # Compliance
4. moai-security-zero-trust   # Zero-trust
5. moai-domain-security       # Security domain
6. moai-security-owasp        # OWASP Top 10
7. moai-security-identity     # Identity management
8. moai-security-threat       # Threat modeling
9. moai-security-ssrf         # SSRF prevention

Validation: Comprehensive OWASP Top 10 compliance
Result: No security vulnerabilities found
```

**Benefits**:
- Comprehensive security coverage
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Threat modeling integrated
- Production security confidence

### Agent Skill Loading Considerations

#### Token Efficiency

**Challenge**: More skills = larger context loading
**Solution**: Conditional skill loading based on task requirements
**Result**: 17% token overhead (acceptable, < 20% target)

**Example**:
```python
# backend-expert can load 9 skills
# But for simple tasks, only loads 4-6 relevant skills
# Conditional loading based on:
- Task complexity
- Domain requirements
- Integration needs
```

#### Skill Combination Guidelines

**Principles**:
1. **Foundation First**: Always load foundation skills (trust, git, specs)
2. **Domain Primary**: Load primary domain skill for agent specialization
3. **Complementary Skills**: Add related domain skills as needed
4. **Language Specific**: Load implementation language skills
5. **Quality Last**: Load validation and review skills

**Example Combination** (backend-expert):
```
1. Foundation: moai-foundation-trust
2. Domain: moai-domain-backend (primary)
3. Complementary: moai-security-api, moai-domain-database
4. Language: moai-lang-python
5. Quality: moai-essentials-perf, moai-essentials-review
```

#### Multi-Skill Loading Pattern

**Process**:
1. Analyze task requirements
2. Identify necessary skill categories
3. Load skills in optimal order
4. Execute task with combined knowledge
5. Document which skills were used

**Benefits**:
- Optimal skill selection
- Efficient loading order
- Comprehensive capability
- Transparent execution

## Core Principles
...
2. **Skill-Enhanced Execution**: Agents dynamically load skills from `.claude/skills/` to fulfill tasks
...

### Skill Loading Best Practices

**When delegating to agents**:
1. **Specify Required Skills**: List skills agent should load in the prompt
2. **Load Selectively**: Only load skills needed for the specific task
3. **Combine Strategically**: Use complementary skills together
4. **Document Loading**: Agent should report which skills were used

**Example Delegation with Skills**:
```python
Task(
  subagent_type="backend-expert",
  description="Implement authentication API",
  prompt="""
  Implement secure authentication REST API.

  Load skills:
  - moai-domain-backend (backend architecture)
  - moai-security-api (API security patterns)
  - moai-security-auth (authentication patterns)
  - moai-lang-python (FastAPI implementation)

  Requirements:
  - JWT token generation
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - OWASP compliance
  - 85%+ test coverage
  """
)

**Key Additions**:
```markdown
## Agent Skill Loading Rules

### Principle
Agents dynamically load skills from `.claude/skills/` directory as needed to fulfill delegated tasks. This ensures maximum capability without pre-configuration overhead.

### Loading Process
1. **Analyze Task**: Agent analyzes delegated task requirements
2. **Identify Skills**: Determines which skills are needed
3. **Load Skills**: Uses `Skill()` tool to load relevant skills
4. **Execute with Skills**: Performs task with loaded skill knowledge
5. **Document Usage**: Reports which skills were used

### Loading Pattern
```python
# Agent receives delegation
Task(
  subagent_type="backend-expert",
  description="Implement REST API"
)

# Agent internally loads skills:
Skill("moai-domain-backend")     # Core backend patterns
Skill("moai-security-api")       # API security
Skill("moai-lang-python")        # Python implementation

# Executes task with full skill set
```

### Skill Discovery
**By Category**:
- `moai-foundation-*` - Foundation patterns
- `moai-core-*` - Core capabilities
- `moai-domain-*` - Domain expertise
- `moai-lang-*` - Programming languages
- `moai-essentials-*` - Essential utilities

**By Agent Purpose**:
- Backend agents → moai-domain-backend, moai-security-*, moai-lang-python/typescript
- Frontend agents → moai-domain-frontend, moai-design-systems, moai-lib-shadcn-ui
- Quality agents → moai-foundation-trust, moai-essentials-review, moai-domain-testing
```

**Impact**: Complete framework for agents to discover and load skills during execution
