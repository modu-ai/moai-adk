## @DOC:MISSION-001 Core Mission

> **"No SPEC, no CODE."**

MoAI-ADK combats Frankenstein code at the root by enforcing a **SPEC-first TDD methodology**.

### Core Value Proposition

#### Four Key Values

1. **Consistency**: A three-step SPEC ‚Üí TDD ‚Üí Sync pipeline safeguards delivery quality.
2. **Quality**: TRUST principles (Test First, Readable, Unified, Secured, Trackable) apply automatically.
3. **Traceability**: The @TAG system (`@SPEC ‚Üí @TEST ‚Üí @CODE ‚Üí @DOC`) preserves end-to-end lineage.
4. **Universality**: Supports diverse programming languages and frameworks.

## @SPEC:USER-001 Primary Users

### Primary Audience: Individual Developers & Teams
- **Who**: Developers working on production codebases who want to adopt AI-assisted development without sacrificing code quality, traceability, or test coverage
- **Core Needs**:
  - Enforce SPEC-first methodology to prevent "Frankenstein code"
  - Maintain high test coverage (85%+) automatically through TDD
  - Preserve end-to-end traceability from requirements to implementation
  - Support multiple programming languages and frameworks
- **Critical Scenarios**:
  - **Scenario 1**: Writing a new feature specification with EARS syntax, then implementing it via RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD cycles
  - **Scenario 2**: Maintaining living documentation that stays synchronized with code through @TAG chains
  - **Scenario 3**: Onboarding to a legacy codebase and understanding architecture through TAG-based traceability

### Secondary Audience: Engineering Managers & Tech Leads
- **Who**: Technical leaders responsible for code quality standards, team productivity, and technical debt management
- **Needs**:
  - Visibility into SPEC coverage, test coverage, and TAG chain integrity
  - Automated quality gates (TRUST principles) enforced at every commit
  - GitFlow automation with draft PR ‚Üí ready PR workflows

## @SPEC:PROBLEM-001 Problems to Solve

### High Priority
1. **Frankenstein Code Anti-Pattern**: AI-assisted development often produces code without specifications, leading to unmaintainable "Frankenstein code" that works but lacks structure, traceability, and long-term maintainability
2. **Lost Traceability**: Traditional development loses the connection between requirements (SPEC), tests (TEST), implementation (CODE), and documentation (DOC), making it impossible to understand why code exists or what it implements
3. **Inconsistent Quality Standards**: Without automated enforcement, code quality varies wildly across team members and projects, leading to technical debt accumulation

### Medium Priority
- **Multi-language Complexity**: Developers working across multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.) struggle to maintain consistent quality standards and testing practices
- **Documentation Drift**: Living documentation quickly becomes stale as code evolves, creating a trust gap between docs and reality
- **Manual GitFlow Overhead**: Repetitive Git workflows (branching, PR creation, tagging, merging) consume significant developer time

### Current Failure Cases
- **Generic AI Coding Tools**: Copilot, Cursor, and other AI assistants focus on code generation without enforcing specifications or test-first discipline
- **Traditional TDD Tools**: Require manual discipline and don't integrate with AI-assisted workflows
- **Documentation Generators**: Produce static snapshots that become outdated immediately after generation

## @DOC:STRATEGY-001 Differentiators & Strengths

### Strengths Versus Alternatives

1. **SPEC-First Enforcement with "No SPEC, No CODE" Philosophy**
   - **When it matters**: When building production systems that require long-term maintainability and onboarding new team members. Unlike Copilot/Cursor that generate code on demand, MoAI-ADK blocks implementation until a SPEC exists, ensuring every line of code has documented intent.
   - **Competitive edge**: Only framework that integrates Claude's reasoning capabilities with mandatory specification authoring (EARS syntax)

2. **End-to-End @TAG Traceability (Code-First, No Cache)**
   - **When it matters**: During code reviews, debugging, or audits when you need to trace why a feature exists, what requirements it satisfies, and which tests validate it. The @TAG chain (`@SPEC ‚Üí @TEST ‚Üí @CODE ‚Üí @DOC`) is scanned directly from source code in real-time.
   - **Competitive edge**: Unlike JIRA/Linear which track issues separately from code, @TAG lives in the code itself via comments

3. **Automated TDD with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Discipline**
   - **When it matters**: When maintaining 85%+ test coverage is non-negotiable. Alfred's code-builder pipeline executes RED (failing test) ‚Üí GREEN (passing implementation) ‚Üí REFACTOR (quality improvement) automatically, with Git commits at each stage.
   - **Competitive edge**: First AI-native TDD framework that enforces test-first via agent workflow, not developer discipline

4. **44 Claude Skills + 12-Agent Orchestration**
   - **When it matters**: When working across multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, etc.) and domains (backend, frontend, ML, DevOps). Skills load just-in-time based on project context.
   - **Competitive edge**: Modular knowledge system beats monolithic LLM context stuffing; Progressive Disclosure reduces token usage by 60%+

5. **Living Documentation via `/alfred:3-sync`**
   - **When it matters**: When documentation must stay synchronized with code automatically. doc-syncer agent regenerates README, CHANGELOG, and TAG reports on every sync.
   - **Competitive edge**: Only framework that treats documentation as a compilation artifact, not a manual task

## @SPEC:SUCCESS-001 Success Metrics

## EARS Requirement Authoring Guide

### EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

Use these EARS patterns to keep SPEC requirements structured:

#### EARS Patterns
1. **Ubiquitous Requirements**: The system shall provide [capability].
2. **Event-driven Requirements**: WHEN [condition], the system shall [behaviour].
3. **State-driven Requirements**: WHILE [state], the system shall [behaviour].
4. **Optional Features**: WHERE [condition], the system may [behaviour].
5. **Constraints**: IF [condition], the system shall enforce [constraint].

#### Sample Application
```markdown
### Ubiquitous Requirements (Foundational)
- The system shall provide user management capabilities.

### Event-driven Requirements
- WHEN a user signs up, the system shall send a welcome email.

### State-driven Requirements
- WHILE a user remains logged in, the system shall display a personalized dashboard.

### Optional Features
- WHERE an account is premium, the system may offer advanced features.

### Constraints
- IF an account is locked, the system shall reject login attempts.
```
