# Progress — SPEC-CODEX-PHASE2-001

## §E.1 Plan-phase Audit-Ready Signal

- plan_status: audit-ready
- tier: M
- artifacts: spec.md + plan.md + acceptance.md (Tier M set)
- spec version: v0.3.0 (plan-audit iteration 2 revision — D1/D2/D3/D4 closed, S2 taken; see `spec.md` HISTORY)
- run-phase entry gate: M0 must close before M1 starts. M0's probe record lands in §E.2 below, under a `### M0 probe — codex-cli <pinned version>` heading, per `plan.md` §D M0 items 2-3.
- open blockers: none. The two `plan.md` §D M0 design forks (background job execution model; write-mode opt-in surface) were resolved by user decision on 2026-08-10 and are recorded as decisions in `plan.md` §D M0 — (i) in-process goroutine, and the `workflow.codex.task.allow_write` config key. spec.md v0.3.0 carries the propagated consistency amendments plus the plan-audit iteration 2 revision. Plan-audit PASSED at 0.84 against the Tier M threshold 0.80 (iteration 2 of 3; report at `.moai/reports/plan-audit/SPEC-CODEX-PHASE2-001-review-2.md`). The SPEC is clear for run-phase, subject to Implementation Kickoff Approval.
