# @SPEC:SPEC-TEST-001: GitHub Issue Automation Test

## HISTORY

| Version | Date | Author | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| v0.1.0 | 2025-10-27 | @goos | draft | Initial test specification for SPEC GitHub Issue automation |

---

## 1. Ubiquitous Requirements

The system MUST:
- Automatically create a GitHub Issue when a SPEC file is pushed to a feature branch
- Extract SPEC metadata from YAML frontmatter (id, version, status, author, priority)
- Populate the GitHub Issue with complete SPEC content
- Link the GitHub Issue back to the pull request

---

## 2. Event-Driven Requirements

WHEN a SPEC file (`.moai/specs/SPEC-*/spec.md`) is pushed to a `feature/SPEC-*` branch:
- THEN extract the SPEC ID from the YAML frontmatter
- THEN parse the main heading to extract the SPEC title
- THEN search for an existing GitHub Issue with the same SPEC ID
- THEN either create a new Issue or update the existing Issue
- THEN add a comment to the pull request linking to the GitHub Issue

---

## 3. State-Driven Requirements

WHILE a pull request is in draft status:
- The GitHub Issue SHOULD be created or updated with the latest SPEC content
- CodeRabbit (local only) SHOULD review the SPEC metadata and structure
- The Issue title MUST match the SPEC heading format

---

## 4. Constraints

- GitHub Issue must be created only on `feature/SPEC-*` branches
- SPEC ID must be extracted from YAML frontmatter (required field)
- SPEC title must be extracted from H1 heading (#)
- SPEC metadata must include 7 required fields: id, version, status, created, updated, author, priority

---

## 5. Optional Features

- CodeRabbit auto-approval when SPEC quality score â‰¥ 80%
- Automatic issue label assignment based on priority
- Automatic assignment to SPEC author

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Create GitHub Issue from SPEC File

**Given** a new SPEC file at `.moai/specs/SPEC-TEST-001/spec.md`

**When** the file is pushed to branch `feature/SPEC-TEST-001`

**Then** a GitHub Issue should be created with:
- Title: "GitHub Issue Automation Test"
- Body containing full SPEC content
- Labels reflecting SPEC priority (medium)
- Link to the pull request in a comment

### Scenario 2: CodeRabbit SPEC Review

**Given** a SPEC file in a draft PR

**When** CodeRabbit review is triggered (local environment)

**Then** CodeRabbit should validate:
- All 7 required metadata fields are present
- HISTORY section exists with proper formatting
- EARS requirements are clearly defined
- Acceptance criteria follow Given-When-Then format
- @TAG system compliance for traceability

### Scenario 3: Traceability Chain

**Given** a SPEC document linked to a GitHub Issue

**When** the PR is merged

**Then** the SPEC history should show:
- Link to GitHub Issue (@TAG:GITHUB-ISSUE)
- Associated tests (@TAG:TEST)
- Implementation code (@TAG:CODE)
- Documentation (@TAG:DOC)

---

## Dependencies & References

- GitHub Issue Template: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/spec.yml`
- GitHub Actions Workflow: `.github/workflows/spec-issue-sync.yml`
- CodeRabbit Configuration: `.coderabbit.yaml`
- SPEC Command: `/alfred:1-plan`

---

## Notes

This is a test SPEC document to validate:
1. GitHub Issue automation (both local and template versions)
2. CodeRabbit SPEC review integration (local only)
3. Full traceability between SPEC files, Issues, and PRs

Expected timeline: GitHub Actions should create Issue within 30 seconds after push, CodeRabbit review within 1-2 minutes.
