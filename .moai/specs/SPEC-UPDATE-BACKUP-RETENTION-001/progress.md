## Revision log (plan-audit iteration 1, D1-D14)

| Finding | Disposition |
|---|---|
| D1 (MP-7, three markers) | Closed. Markers deleted from plan.md §B; Q1-Q3 answers recorded in decision-index.md with date 2026-10-16, verdict source "operator via brain"; Q1 (report only), Q2 (soft cap), Q3 (no reintroduction) folded into REQ-UBR-010/015/016/018 and AC-UBR-04/05/06/15/18. |
| D2 (REQ-005 vs 008 vs 010, design D2 step 4, AC-11) | Closed. Single disposition: an unclassifiable (FIFO-only, unreadable) run is an exempt run, retained unconditionally and counted as a holder; REQ-005 carries the exception, REQ-010 says "plus the exempt runs", design D2 step 4 never drops exempt runs, AC-UBR-11 asserts the FIFO-only case. |
| D3 (AC-06(b) equality with a non-unique cover) | Closed. (b) asserts coverage, irredundancy and the bound "retained non-exempt excess runs at most the number of distinct protected versions"; no equality; design D2 gives the {abc},{a},{b},{c} counter-shape. |
| D4 ((a) cannot fail; mutant note wrong) | Closed. (a) replaced by "runs present = keepCount + R, R named in the report"; mutant note corrected (keep-everything fails (b) irredundancy); the card's "at or under cap" wording replaced in REQ-UBR-010 rationale by the soft-cap form. |
| D5 (Q2 evidence ordering) | Closed. Q2 is ruled and Q4 closed; no decision depends on the figure; the oracle can compute R from the pre-prune census at any time (design D2); AC-UBR-06 prints it as a measured output; the "before run-phase entry" obligation for the figure is deleted. |
| D6 (Q6 misclassified, false rationale) | Closed. Q6 reclassified product-level, DEFAULT-APPLIED removed; the default (keep current non-refusing report-only behavior, measured E4) recorded as consistent with the 3.2 principle; closed by the Q3 ruling. |
| D7 (AC-UBR-20 given clause vs M2 Exit) | Closed. Split: AC-UBR-19 (CleanupOldBackups row) bound to M2 Exit; AC-UBR-20 (rename site row) bound to M3 Exit. |
| D8 (bookkeeping shape imitation) | Deferred by design, recorded: design D4 residual and spec risk 7; provenance is a larger design choice; no unsafe fixture asserted. |
| D9 (RED-now commands not self-contained) | Closed. Overlay files rewritten with tree-relative paths (`overlay_*.rel.json`), commands in research.md/acceptance.md have no placeholder; the placement steps and the overlay JSON text are in research.md Appendix A.3; probes-only-log caveat stated; commands re-executed in this run. |
| D10 (AC-UBR-19 without Exit) | Closed. M4 has an Exit line naming AC-UBR-18 (the F21 criterion, renumbered). |
| D11 (Q5 default rationale cites reverted code) | Closed. Rationale rewritten: no current behavior exists; rule applied is the smaller user-visible surface. |
| D12 (REQ-020/021 verification-layer) | Kept as requirements (renumbered REQ-UBR-019/020); harmless, tier ceiling respected. |
| D13 (unlisted `related_specs` field) | Closed. Field removed; the three SPEC ids moved to HISTORY. |
| D14 (AC-UBR-23 judgment wording) | Closed. The expected tracked-change set is named in AC-UBR-23. |

Additional folds from the leader brief: baseline on main added (research.md, spec A.2, plan A.1); reference behavior `8e43f064a^` in design D0; main-versus-tree RED/GREEN cells in AC-UBR-01 to AC-UBR-06; post-landing operator verification in design D11; counts 20 requirements, 24 acceptance criteria (ceilings 25/25).
