Card: t342 · Tier M · Worktree `.claude/worktrees/t342`, branch `WT-moving-ref-guard`.

## §E.1 Plan-phase Audit-Ready Signal

Plan-phase artifacts authored 2026-08-28 in worktree
`/Users/goos/MoAI/moai-adk-go/.claude/worktrees/t342` at HEAD `ec15ec2cd`, working tree clean at
authoring time.

**Measurements taken during authoring** (each re-run in this tree, not carried over):

| Figure | Command | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Tree identity | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` | `…/.claude/worktrees/t342` |
| Branch | `git branch --show-current` | `WT-moving-ref-guard` |
| HEAD | `git rev-parse --short HEAD` | `ec15ec2cd` |
| Branch provenance | `git reflog show WT-moving-ref-guard` | created from `origin/develop` at `ec15ec2cd` |
| Merge-base degeneration | `git merge-base ec15ec2cd 44095ddc2` | `44095ddc2cc1c9fed2b3bd5ac946f48017988aba` |
| Two-dot, stale anchor | `git diff --stat 44095ddc2 -- internal/hook` | `3 files changed, 288 insertions(+)` |
| Three-dot, stale anchor | `git diff --stat 44095ddc2...HEAD -- internal/hook` | `3 files changed, 288 insertions(+)` |
| Two-dot, current anchor | `git diff --stat ec15ec2cd -- internal/hook` | *(empty)* |
| Corpus filter 1 | moving-ref mentions in `.moai/specs/**/*.md` | `1477` |
| Corpus filter 2 | + git-command context | `527` |
| Corpus filter 3 | + invariant-claim marker | `53` |
| Corpus filter 4 | − lines carrying a 7-40 hex SHA | `42` |
| SPEC ID validity | Bash ERE check against `internal/spec/lint.go` `specIDPattern` | `PASS` |

The filter-4 set of 42 was enumerated in full and read, not sampled. Its three-way classification is
recorded in `spec.md` §B.3.

**Explicitly NOT observed at plan-phase** (Gaps):

- The detector does not exist, so the 42-line candidate set is a *grep prevalence measurement*, not
  a rule output. The M4 triage count may differ once the real pattern is implemented, and no
  criterion here assumes the two agree.
- The corpus classification in `spec.md` §B.3 names seven anchor-class and two subject-class lines
  by identifier; the remaining candidates were read but are not individually classified in the
  plan-phase artifact. Full classification is M4's deliverable.
- No `go test` was run — plan-phase authored no Go code.
- The claim that three-dot is stable under *diverging* upstream advance (as opposed to the absorbed
  advance measured above) was reasoned, not measured; fabricating a diverging branch pair was
  judged out of proportion for a plan-phase figure. `spec.md` §B.2 states the mechanism and cites
  only the measurement actually taken.

**Residual risk:** the exemption predicate (`spec.md` §D.1) is a judgment procedure. Its three tests
were validated against four real instances, all of which it classifies correctly — but four
instances is a small validation set, and a fifth disposition may exist that the anchor/subject
dichotomy does not cover. `spec.md` §H carries the open questions rather than closing them.

**Status transition:** `(none) → draft`, emitted across all four plan-phase artifacts.
