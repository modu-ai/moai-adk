# SPEC-GRAPH-FRESHNESS-CADENCE-001 — Progress

## §E.1 Plan-phase Audit-Ready Signal

Plan-phase artifacts authored for card t322 in worktree
`/Users/goos/MoAI/moai-adk-go/.claude/worktrees/t322`, branch `WT-graph-freshness-cadence`, base
`d2cba5e21`.

- Tier: **M** — artifact set `spec.md` + `plan.md` + `acceptance.md` (+ this file). 12 requirements
  (ceiling 16), 13 acceptance criteria (ceiling 16).
- Baseline: every figure in `spec.md` §B re-measured in this tree during authoring. The dispatch's
  figures (55 / 0 / 5 per integration; 21 / 198 calibration re-run) reproduced exactly.
- Judgments (as of v0.2.0): `spec.md` §D.1 (a — yes, predicate in the metric), §D.2 (b — **40
  retained**, re-justified on the integration axis; the v0.1.0 proposal of 15 was reversed by audit
  D2), §D.3 (c — no pipeline refresh; attribution instead). Rejected alternatives recorded per
  judgment.

## §E.1b Plan-phase Audit Record

- Audit iter-1 (`plan-auditor`): **PASS-WITH-DEBT 0.82** (Tier M PASS threshold 0.80), MP-1..MP-4
  all pass, four blocking defects (D1 critical, D2/D3/D4 major) plus D5-D8 optional. Verdict:
  `.moai/reports/t322/plan-audit.md`.
- Remediation landed at v0.2.0; the per-defect account is the `spec.md` HISTORY row for that
  version. D1 was additionally confirmed by the orchestrator directly against source
  (`internal/mx/provenance.go:107-143` applies no extension filter; `internal/graph/meta.go:67`
  routes three non-Go directories through it), so it is an established finding rather than an
  auditor hypothesis.
- D2 reversed the threshold judgment: the v0.1.0 value 15 was derived on the per-integration axis
  while the metric is cumulative-since-stamp; on the cumulative axis 15 reds the gate roughly twice
  per day at the observed integration rate, and the streak this SPEC exists to fix carries a
  corrected cumulative of 2 — under both 15 and 40. The threshold change was therefore not
  load-bearing for the defect and is now out of scope.
- Re-audit after remediation: **pending** — the remediation commit has not been re-audited.
- Ordering basis for t322 / t311 / t304: `spec.md` §F.
- Open questions deliberately left to the operator: `spec.md` §G (three).
- Evidence path: `.moai/reports/t322/`.
