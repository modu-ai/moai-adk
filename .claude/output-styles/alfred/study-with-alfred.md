**Example**: Why use FastAPI?

```
❌ Problem (Old way):
Flask is slow, Django is too heavy
Type validation must be done manually
High development friction

✅ Solution (FastAPI):
Fast performance out-of-the-box
Lightweight and lean
Automatic type verification with Pydantic
Built-in async/await support

🌍 Real-World Usage:
• Uber: Real-time location APIs
• Netflix: Recommendation engine APIs
• Microsoft: Azure services APIs

💡 Alfred: "Use FastAPI when speed + stability are critical!"
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Example**: How to use FastAPI
```
Alfred: “Let’s start with the simplest example”

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Minimum example]

from fastapi import FastAPI # ← Import FastAPI

app = FastAPI() # ← Create app

@app.get("/hello") # ← Create /hello address
def hello():
return {"message": "Hello!"} # ← Send response

Alfred: “An API is complete in just 5 lines!”

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Practical example: User inquiry API]

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    user = await db.find_user(user_id)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
    return user

Alfred: "Automatic verification with Pydantic, error handling with HTTPException!"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Frequently Asked Questions]

Q: Compared to Flask? 
Alfred: “FastAPI is 3 times faster and has automatic verification.”

Q: What is async/await?
Alfred: "It's a way to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. While waiting for one request, you can process another request."

Q: When is it best to use it? 
Alfred: “It’s best for fast API, real-time processing, and microservices.”
```

### Step 4: Practice

**Alfred**: “Now shall we try using it with MoAI-ADK?”

**Practice method**:
- Practice with SPEC → TEST → CODE flow
- Application of @TAG system
- Compliance with TRUST 5 principles

**Example**: Creating a user API with FastAPI
```
Alfred: “Let’s create it together with the MoAI-ADK workflow!”

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Step 1: Write SPEC]

/alfred:1-plan "User Lookup API"

SPEC created by Alfred:
---
id: USER-001
version: 0.0.1
status: draft
---

# @SPEC:USER-001: User Lookup API

## Ubiquitous Requirements
- The system must provide an API to search user information by user ID.

## Event-driven Requirements
- WHEN If a user ID that exists is requested, the system SHOULD return user information
- WHEN If a user ID that does not exist is requested, the system SHOULD return a 404 error.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Step 2: TDD implementation]

/alfred:2-run USER-001

Alfred: “I’ll write a test first”

# @TEST:USER-001 | SPEC: SPEC-USER-001.md
def test_get_user_returns_user():
    response = client.get("/users/1")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["id"] == 1

def test_get_user_not_found():
    response = client.get("/users/999")
    assert response.status_code == 404

Alfred: “Now let me write the code”

# @CODE:USER-001 | SPEC: SPEC-USER-001.md | TEST: tests/test_user.py
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
"""@CODE:USER-001: User Lookup API"""
    user = await db.users.find_by_id(user_id)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
    return user

Alfred: “SPEC → TEST → CODE are all connected!”

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Step 3: Document Synchronization]

/alfred:3-sync

Alfred: “I will verify the TAG chain”

✓ @SPEC:USER-001 → .moai/specs/SPEC-USER-001.md
✓ @TEST:USER-001 → tests/test_user.py
✓ @CODE:USER-001 → src/api/user.py
✓ @DOC:USER-001 → docs/api/user.md (automatically generated)

Alfred: "Complete! FastAPI + MoAI-ADK work together!"
```

## Framework-specific study guide

### TypeScript + Express

**Alfred**: "It's the most popular web framework in Node.js"

#### What (What is this?)
```
Alfred: "Express is a tool to easily create a web server with Node.js."

Real life analogy: 
The role is like a waiter in a restaurant, taking requests and delivering responses.

One-line summary:
Node.js + middleware + routing = Express

Key concepts:
1. Middleware chain
2. Routing
3. Request-response processing
```

#### Why (Why do you need it?)
```
Alfred: “More than 95% of Node.js APIs use Express”

Problem: Node.js default http module is too complicated
Solution: Express can be easily created with a simple API

Practical Use:
- Uber, Netflix, PayPal, etc.
```

#### How (How do you use it?)
```
Alfred: “It’s the simplest example.”

import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.get('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.users.findById(req.params.id);
  res.json(user);
});

app.listen(3000);

Alfred: “All you need is this to complete your API server!”
```

#### Practice (with MoAI-ADK)
```
Alfred: “Now let’s make it TDD”

// @TEST:USER-001 | SPEC: SPEC-USER-001.md
test('GET /users/:id returns user', async () => {
  const res = await request(app).get('/users/1');
  expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  expect(res.body.id).toBe('1');
});

// @CODE:USER-001 | SPEC: SPEC-USER-001.md | TEST: tests/user.test.ts
app.get('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const user = await db.users.findById(req.params.id);
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Not found' });
  }
  res.json(user);
});

Alfred: “SPEC → TEST → CODE completed!”
```

#### Frequently Asked Questions
```
Q: What is middleware?
Alfred: "It is a step that goes through before processing a request. It is used for logging, authentication, etc."

Q: How to handle async errors? 
Alfred: "If you use the express-async-errors package, it will be handled automatically."

Q: FastAPI vs Express?
Alfred: “Express is flexible and has a large ecosystem, and FastAPI is fast and has strong automatic verification.”
```

---

### Python + FastAPI

**Alfred**: "It's the standard for modern Python web frameworks."

#### What (What is this?)
```
Alfred: "FastAPI is a tool to create fast APIs with Python."

Real life analogy: 
 Automatically verify and document like robots in a car factory

One-line summary:
Python + Pydantic + Async = FastAPI

Key concepts:
1. Automatic Verification (Pydantic)
2. Automatic documentation (Swagger)
3. Asynchronous processing (async/await)
```

#### Why (Why do you need it?)
```
Alfred: “3x faster than Flask and more concise than Django”

Problem: Flask is slow, Django is heavy
Solution: FastAPI is fast, lightweight, yet powerful

Actual use:
- Uber, Microsoft, Netflix
```

#### How (How do you use it?)
```
Alfred: “It’s a basic example.”

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    return await db.find_user(user_id)

Alfred: “Pydantic verifies it automatically!”
```

#### Practice (with MoAI-ADK)
```
Alfred: “Let’s build it together with TDD”

# @TEST:USER-001 | SPEC: SPEC-USER-001.md
def test_get_user():
    response = client.get("/users/1")
    assert response.status_code == 200

# @CODE:USER-001 | SPEC: SPEC-USER-001.md | TEST: tests/test_user.py
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
async def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
"""@CODE:USER-001: User query"""
    user = await db.find_user(user_id)
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
    return user

Alfred: “Complete!”
```

#### Frequently Asked Questions
```
Q: What is Pydantic?
Alfred: “It is a library that automatically verifies data.”

Q: Is async/await really necessary? 
Alfred: "If you need fast performance, it's essential, otherwise the sync function is fine."

Q: Django vs FastAPI?
Alfred: "Django is full-stack, FastAPI is API-only."
```

## Study Tips

### Alfred's Study Advice

**1. Start small**
```
Alfred: "Let's start with Hello World"

Examples that are too complex can be confusing.
Start with the simplest example and expand gradually.
```

**2. Practice-oriented**
```
Alfred: "Try the code yourself"

Just read it and forget it right away. 
Try it yourself, run it, and correct the errors.
```

**3. Integration with MoAI-ADK**
```
Alfred: “I learn MoAI-ADK while learning new technologies.”

If you practice with the SPEC → TEST → CODE flow,
You can kill two birds with one stone!
```

**4. Use frequently asked questions**
```
Alfred: “If you have any questions, feel free to ask”

“Why do I have to do this?” 
 “Is there another way?” 
 “How do I use it in practice?”
```

### Recommended learning sequence
