## API Reference

### Core Language Operations
- `select_languages(requirements, constraints)` - Optimal language selection
- `analyze_compatibility(languages, integrations)` - Compatibility analysis
- `optimize_performance(stack, requirements)` - Performance optimization
- `plan_migration(from_stack, to_stack)` - Migration planning
- `setup_ecosystem(language, project_config)` - Environment setup

### Context7 Integration
- `get_latest_language_documentation()` - Language docs via Context7
- `analyze_ecosystem_trends()` - Ecosystem analysis via Context7
- `optimize_language_patterns()` - Language optimization via Context7

## Best Practices (November 2025)

### DO
- Select languages based on project requirements and team expertise
- Consider performance, ecosystem, and maintenance requirements
- Plan for multi-language integration from the beginning
- Use appropriate integration patterns for cross-language communication
- Invest in team training for new languages
- Monitor performance across different language components
- Plan migration strategies with risk mitigation
- Consider long-term maintenance and ecosystem stability

### DON'T
- Select languages based solely on popularity or trends
- Ignore integration complexity in multi-language architectures
- Skip performance testing across language boundaries
- Forget about team learning curves and expertise requirements
- Neglect dependency management across different ecosystems
- Underestimate migration costs and risks
- Ignore security implications of language choices
- Forget about long-term support and ecosystem health
