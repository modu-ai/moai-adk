## API Reference

### Core EARS Operations
- `evaluate_context(problem_context, stakeholders)` - Evaluate problem context
- `analyze_problem(evaluation, symptoms)` - Analyze problem structure
- `recommend_solutions(analysis, constraints)` - Generate solution recommendations
- `synthesize_solution(evaluation, analysis, recommendations)` - Synthesize final solution
- `validate_implementation(synthesis, metrics)` - Validate implementation approach

### Context7 Integration
- `get_latest_requirements_docs()` - Requirements engineering via Context7
- `analyze_systematic_thinking_patterns()` - Problem-solving methodologies via Context7
- `optimize_solution_synthesis()` - Solution optimization via Context7

## Best Practices (November 2025)

### DO
- Follow the EARS framework systematically for complex problems
- Involve all relevant stakeholders throughout the process
- Use data-driven analysis for objective decision making
- Document all assumptions, constraints, and decisions
- Validate solutions with stakeholders before implementation
- Consider multiple solution alternatives and approaches
- Plan for risks and develop mitigation strategies
- Establish clear success metrics and validation criteria

### DON'T
- Skip phases or rush through the systematic analysis
- Ignore stakeholder requirements and concerns
- Rely on assumptions without data validation
- Overlook constraint analysis and resource limitations
- Forget to document the analysis and decision process
- Implement solutions without proper validation
- Neglect risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Skip success metrics definition and monitoring

## Works Well With

- `moai-foundation-specs` (SPEC lifecycle management)
- `moai-alfred-spec-authoring` (SPEC creation and writing)
- `moai-foundation-trust` (Trust and quality principles)
- `moai-domain-backend` (Technical solution implementation)
- `moai-security-api` (Security requirements analysis)
- `moai-essentials-perf` (Performance requirements)
- `moai-domain-devops` (Implementation planning)
- `moai-foundation-git` (Version control and collaboration)
