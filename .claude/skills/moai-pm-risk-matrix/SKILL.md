# Risk Assessment Matrix Best Practices

## Overview

A risk assessment matrix (also called probability-impact matrix or risk heat map) is a visual tool for identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing project risks. This skill covers risk identification techniques, 5x5 matrix construction, mitigation strategies, and continuous risk monitoring patterns.

## Key Patterns

### 1. 5x5 Risk Matrix Structure

**Pattern**: Use 5x5 matrix for granular risk categorization.

```markdown
# Risk Assessment Matrix

## Impact Scale (Columns)
1. **Negligible**: <$5K impact, <1 day delay
2. **Minor**: $5K-$25K, 1-5 days delay
3. **Moderate**: $25K-$100K, 1-2 weeks delay
4. **Major**: $100K-$500K, 2-4 weeks delay
5. **Catastrophic**: >$500K, >1 month delay or project cancellation

## Likelihood Scale (Rows)
1. **Rare**: <10% probability (unlikely to occur)
2. **Unlikely**: 10-30% probability
3. **Possible**: 30-50% probability
4. **Likely**: 50-70% probability
5. **Almost Certain**: >70% probability

## Risk Score Calculation
Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

| Likelihood      | Negligible (1) | Minor (2) | Moderate (3) | Major (4) | Catastrophic (5) |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------------- |
| Almost Certain (5) | 5 (Medium)   | 10 (High) | 15 (High)    | 20 (Critical) | 25 (Critical) |
| Likely (4)      | 4 (Low)        | 8 (Medium)| 12 (High)    | 16 (High)     | 20 (Critical) |
| Possible (3)    | 3 (Low)        | 6 (Medium)| 9 (Medium)   | 12 (High)     | 15 (High)     |
| Unlikely (2)    | 2 (Low)        | 4 (Low)   | 6 (Medium)   | 8 (Medium)    | 10 (High)     |
| Rare (1)        | 1 (Low)        | 2 (Low)   | 3 (Low)      | 4 (Low)       | 5 (Medium)    |

## Priority Actions
- **Critical (20-25)**: Immediate action required, escalate to sponsor
- **High (12-16)**: Develop detailed mitigation plan within 1 week
- **Medium (5-9)**: Monitor closely, prepare contingency plan
- **Low (1-4)**: Monitor periodically, accept risk if cost-effective
```

### 2. Risk Identification Process

**Pattern**: Use structured techniques to discover risks early.

```markdown
## Risk Identification Techniques

### 1. Brainstorming Session
- **Participants**: Project team, stakeholders, subject matter experts
- **Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Output**: 20-50 potential risks identified

### 2. SWOT Analysis
| Strengths         | Weaknesses            |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Experienced team  | Limited budget        |
| Executive support | Shared resources      |

| Opportunities           | Threats                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Market demand growing   | Competitor launching first |
| New technology available| Regulatory changes pending |

### 3. Risk Categories (PESTLE)
- **Political**: Regulatory changes, government policies
- **Economic**: Budget cuts, inflation, currency fluctuations
- **Social**: User adoption resistance, cultural barriers
- **Technological**: API deprecation, security vulnerabilities
- **Legal**: Compliance requirements, contract disputes
- **Environmental**: Remote work challenges, office relocation

### 4. Historical Data Review
Review lessons learned from similar projects:
- Previous migration project: data quality issues (likelihood: 70%)
- Past redesign: scope creep from stakeholders (likelihood: 60%)
```

### 3. Risk Register Template

**Pattern**: Document all identified risks in a structured register.

```markdown
## Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk Description               | Category    | Likelihood | Impact | Score | Priority | Owner      |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| R-001   | Key developer leaves team      | Resource    | Possible (3)| Major (4)| 12  | High     | PM         |
| R-002   | API instability during migration| Technical  | Unlikely (2)| Catastrophic (5)| 10 | High | Tech Lead |
| R-003   | Scope creep from stakeholders  | Management  | Likely (4) | Major (4)| 16  | High     | Sponsor    |
| R-004   | Low user adoption              | Business    | Possible (3)| Major (4)| 12  | High     | Product Owner|
| R-005   | Budget overrun                 | Financial   | Possible (3)| Moderate (3)| 9 | Medium  | PM         |
| R-006   | Third-party vendor delays      | External    | Unlikely (2)| Moderate (3)| 6 | Medium  | Vendor Manager|
| R-007   | Data migration complexity      | Technical   | Likely (4) | Major (4)| 16  | High     | Data Lead  |
| R-008   | Security vulnerability         | Compliance  | Rare (1)   | Catastrophic (5)| 5 | Medium | Security Lead|

### Risk Details: R-001 - Key Developer Leaves Team

**Description**: Senior frontend developer may accept offer from competitor

**Root Causes**:
- Competitive job market for React developers
- Compensation below market rate
- Limited career growth visibility

**Triggers**:
- Developer updates LinkedIn profile
- Increase in recruiter calls
- Negative performance review feedback

**Current Status**: Active (as of 2025-10-31)
```

### 4. Risk Response Strategies

**Pattern**: Apply appropriate response based on risk type and priority.

```markdown
## Risk Response Strategies

### 1. Avoid (Eliminate the risk)
**When**: High impact risks with viable alternatives
**Example**: 
- **Risk**: API instability
- **Response**: Use stable v2 API instead of beta v3 API
- **Outcome**: Risk eliminated

### 2. Mitigate (Reduce probability or impact)
**When**: High/medium risks where avoidance is not feasible
**Example**:
- **Risk**: Key developer leaves (Likelihood: Possible, Impact: Major)
- **Response**:
  1. Cross-train 2 team members on React codebase
  2. Document all critical code patterns
  3. Offer retention bonus tied to project completion
  4. Implement pair programming for knowledge transfer
- **Outcome**: Likelihood reduced to Unlikely (2), Impact reduced to Moderate (3)
- **New Score**: 6 (Medium)

### 3. Transfer (Shift responsibility)
**When**: Risks outside team's expertise or control
**Example**:
- **Risk**: Data migration complexity
- **Response**: Hire specialized migration consultant (fixed-price contract)
- **Outcome**: Risk transferred to vendor (with SLA penalties)

### 4. Accept (Monitor and prepare contingency)
**When**: Low-priority risks or cost of mitigation exceeds potential loss
**Example**:
- **Risk**: Minor UI bug in edge case browser
- **Response**: Document as known issue, monitor user reports
- **Contingency**: Fix in next sprint if >5 users affected
```

### 5. Mitigation Plan Template

**Pattern**: Create actionable mitigation plans for high-priority risks.

```markdown
## Mitigation Plan: R-003 - Scope Creep

### Risk Details
- **Current Score**: 16 (High)
- **Target Score**: 6 (Medium)
- **Timeline**: Implement by 2025-11-15

### Mitigation Actions

| Action                              | Owner      | Deadline   | Status      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Establish change control board      | PM         | 2025-11-05 | Completed   |
| Document scope freeze date          | PM         | 2025-11-08 | In Progress |
| Create change request template      | PM         | 2025-11-10 | Pending     |
| Train stakeholders on CR process    | Product Owner| 2025-11-15| Pending     |
| Set up weekly scope review meetings | PM         | 2025-11-05 | Completed   |

### Success Criteria
- All change requests require sponsor approval
- <3 approved scope changes per month
- Zero unauthorized feature additions
- Stakeholder satisfaction with process >4/5

### Contingency Plan (if mitigation fails)
1. Escalate to executive sponsor immediately
2. Request timeline extension (2-4 weeks)
3. Request additional budget ($25K-$50K)
4. Defer low-priority features to Phase 2
```

### 6. Risk Monitoring Dashboard

**Pattern**: Track risk trends over time.

```markdown
## Risk Dashboard (Monthly Update)

### Risk Trend Analysis

| Month   | Critical | High | Medium | Low | New Risks | Closed Risks |
| ------- | -------- | ---- | ------ | --- | --------- | ------------ |
| Oct '25 | 0        | 4    | 3      | 8   | 15        | 0            |
| Nov '25 | 1        | 3    | 4      | 7   | 2         | 3            |
| Dec '25 | 0        | 2    | 5      | 8   | 1         | 2            |

### Top 3 Active Risks
1. **R-003**: Scope creep (Score: 16 → 12, improving)
2. **R-007**: Data migration complexity (Score: 16 → 16, stable)
3. **R-001**: Key developer leaving (Score: 12 → 6, improving)

### Recently Closed Risks
- **R-010**: Vendor selection delayed (Closed: 2025-11-20, Vendor selected)
